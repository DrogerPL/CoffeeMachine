This Java program simulates a coffee machine, allowing users to perform actions such as buying coffee, refilling 
supplies (water, milk, coffee beans, cups), taking out money earned from selling coffee, and checking the current state of the machine.
The program uses basic console input/output and a simple switch-case structure to handle user interactions.
